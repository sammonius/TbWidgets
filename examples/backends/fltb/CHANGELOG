    CHANGELOG:
------------------
This file outlines the changes made to the original
FLWM code. Following that part is a timeline of changes
made after the initial release (aka an actual changelog)


CHANGES TO FLWM:
----------
The new file created for handling toolbar widgets is
called "tbwBackend.C". This is where all the exitement
happens.

First of all, at around line 330 of "main.C", there's
a block called "find all the windows and create a frame
for each." FLWM would create a Frame object for each
window without storing it, which would need to be changed
so that apps could call "getWindowTb()". This was changed
by creating a list of Frames in tbwBackend.C and having
the Frame constructor/destructor add and remove the frame
from the list.
