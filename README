TbWidgets
--------------
TbWidgets is a library that allows clients to
add graphical widgets through the window manager (or compositor).
It's intended to be an alternative to CSD that makes both "modern"
and "traditional" desktop users happy.

The way it works is that an app sends instructions to the WM
for what to draw on its titlebar (and which window to draw it
on, obviously). On Mutter it could look exactly like a GTK
headerbar, but it would also look natural on other WMs at
the same time. Keep in mind that no WM has actually implemented
this yet, and it's a work in progress.
